= 366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree/

Given the root of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:

1. Collect all the leaf nodes.
2. Remove all the leaf nodes.
3. Repeat until the tree is empty.

.Example 1:
[source]
----
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
----

.Example 2:
[source]
----
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
----

.Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
